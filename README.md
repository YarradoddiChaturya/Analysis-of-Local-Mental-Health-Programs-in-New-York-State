### Project Proposal: Analysis of Local Mental Health Programs in New York State



### Location of the Data Source:



The "Local Mental Health Programs" dataset is freely accessible on the Open Data NY platform from the New York State Department of Health.



### Link to the dataset: 



https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Local-Mental-Health-Programs/6nvr-tbv8/about_data



### Data Discovery:



I checked the Open Data NY portal by clicking on the URLs supplied in the Blackboard course materials. I opened the health section of that webpage and used search terms such as "mental health services," "geographic distribution of health programs," and "New York mental health data." This dataset has been chosen after reviewing a few, as it fits into my area of interest and is an informative one regarding the types of programs offered and geographic locations.



### Data Accessibility and Legality:



The data freely opens for download with no costs accruing. The publishing authority is a government body, and downloading or making use of the said dataset does not constitute a breach of the terms of service. This is a public dataset meant for research, development of public policy, and general awareness.



### EDA Documentation:



There are no documented exploratory data analyses for this dataset, and this provides a fresh opportunity for original exploration and analysis. The dataset comes as raw data without any pre-existing cleaning, organization, or analysis efforts documented by other users.



### Overview of the Dataset:



Range Index: 6408 entries, 0 to 6407

Data: 26 

Dtypes: float64(2), int64(4), object(20)

Size: Approximately 2.3 MB in CSV format



### Why did I choose this data?



The basis for choosing this dataset is the ample amount of experience I had with healthcare-related data while I was working at Healthark Insights. This seemed to have grown an urge in me to understand and analyze health-related data sets. Processing this data set, I am curious about finding patterns and insights that might allow a better comprehension of healthcare services. This will help me to dive deep and apply the skillset I have learned.



### Questions:



Geographic Distribution: Are there more mental health programs per capita available in urban areas, such as New York City compared to rural areas in New York State?
Program Type vs. Population Served: Do treatment-based mental health programs serve more adults, while support services serve more children and adolescents?
County Distribution: Does the number of programs significantly vary by median income class?
Program Tier and Operating Certificate: On average, are operating certificates longer for higher-tier programs as compared to lower-tier programs?
Program Type and Geographic Region: Are certain types of mental health programs (e.g., residential treatment) concentrated in certain areas/regions (e.g., New York City vs. Hudson River)?
